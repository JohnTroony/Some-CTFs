**Description:**

While wandering alongside the beach, you spot an unknown object in the distance.
Wondering what it might be, you go closer and realise that it's a scroll. In clear letters it's "For in strange aeons, when death has died..." written on it. 
This sounds somewhat familiar and Cthulhu related. Could it be that there is more hidden inside [this scroll](survival-guide.zip) than just the beginning of this sentence? Maybe even instruction how to survive when Cthulhu awakens?

## Hint

Skywing and j00ru are such cool guys. They know tricks to let the entry point start anywhere.
